                <h2>About Muscle Cars</h2>
                <h5>What about Muscle cars?</h5>
                <p>
                    Muscle cars are known for their powerful engines and a broad, boxy shape
                    The “Muscle Car” has roots dating back to the late 1940’s,
                    evolving out of post-WWII American hot rod culture and into a segment all its own.
                    By the 1960’s and 1970’s, the term was broadly given to 2-door, 2-row American sport cars
                    that boasted powerful V8 engines that sent power to the rear wheels. In true American spirit,
                    muscle cars tended to carry relatively affordable price tags for their performance, especially in the straight line. 
                    It’s no wonder why muscle car culture is the backbone for several racing leagues, such as NASCAR, NHRA and even the SCCA, 
                    even to this day.
